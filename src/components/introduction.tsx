      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am a full-stack developer who recently graduated from mechatronic studies in Lithuania. I have completed courses in artificial intelligence (Python) and embedded programming (C). In my spare time, I have developed a couple of Android games and apps. Additionally, I successfully finished a web development course at <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a>. In my spare time, I enjoy working out, meditating, expanding my knowledge in artificial intelligence, and working on new projects.
