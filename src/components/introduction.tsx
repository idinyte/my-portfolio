      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am a junior full-stack developer and a last-year mechatronics student. I had courses in artificial intelligence (Python) and embedded programming (C).
        In my spare time, I made a couple of Android games (in C#).
        During the past two years, I have focused on learning web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> theodinproject</a>
        . I'm constantly learning and creating new things.
